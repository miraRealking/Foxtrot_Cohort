from functools import reduce
# ================== PYTHON HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS ASSIGNMENT ==================

# 1. Create a simple function called greet() that returns "Hello, how are you?".
#    Then call the function and print the result.
# Answer no 1 here.
def greet():
    return "Hello, how are you?"


# 2. Create a function called call_function(func) that takes another function as an argument
#    and returns the result of calling that function.
#    Use it to call greet() from question 1.
# Answer no 2 here.
def call_function(func):
    return func()

print(
    call_function(greet)
)

# 3. Given numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#    Use the map() function to multiply each number by 3 and print the new list.
# Answer no 3 here.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

multiply = map(lambda item: item * 3, numbers)
print(list(multiply))

# 4. Using filter(), get only the numbers that are greater than 10
#    from this list: nums = [5, 12, 8, 20, 3, 15]
# Answer no 4 here.
nums = [5, 12, 8, 20, 3, 15]
greater_than_ten = filter(lambda item: item > 10, nums)
print(list(greater_than_ten))


# 5. Using reduce() from functools, find the total sum of this list:
#    values = [10, 20, 30, 40]
# Answer no 5 here.
values = [10, 20, 30, 40]
total_sum = reduce(lambda a, b : a + b, values)
print(total_sum)

# 6. Write a lambda function that takes one number and returns the number multiplied by 5.
#    Test it with the number 6.
# Answer no 6 here.

multiple_func = lambda num: num * 5
print(
    multiple_func(15)
)


# 7. Create a nested function:
#    - outer_function() should define an inner_function() that returns "Inner function called".
#    - The outer_function() should return the result of inner_function().
#    - Call outer_function() and print the result.
# Answer no 7 here.
def outer_function():
    def inner_function():
        return "Inner function called"
    return inner_function()

print(
    outer_function()
)

# 8. Using list comprehension, create a new list that contains each number squared
#    from the list numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8].
# Answer no 8 here.
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
squared_numbers = [item ** 2 for item in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)

# 9. Using list comprehension, create a list that contains only even numbers
#    from numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
# Answer no 9 here.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)

# 10. Combine map() and lambda:
#     From data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
#     use map() with a lambda to add 2 to every number.
#     Print the new list.
# Answer no 10 here.
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

add_2 = map(lambda item: item + 2, data)
print(list(add_2))
