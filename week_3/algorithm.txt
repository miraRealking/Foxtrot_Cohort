1. Create a list called expenses. It's going to be a list of dictionary in this format e.g [{"expense": "Transportation", "price": 400}].

2. create inputs: expense, price.

3. Create a dictionary with the keys and values of expense and price.

4. Write an if else statement. If price is greater than (put your price), update the dictionary with the key "is_over_the_budget", set True and append to expenses.
   Else add the same type of key "is_over_the_budget", set to False and append to expenses.
